## [1.1.1] - 2015-12-04

### Fixed

* CHANGELOG wasn't up to date with 1.1 changes
* Improved README's descriptions of new changes.

## [1.1] - 2015-12-04

### Added
* now supports module namespacing

### Notes
1.0 was originally 0.5, but I mistakenly left the `mdcd.meta` file 
at 1.0 when it was released. So, there's now a `v1.0` tag at what was/is
`v0.5` to avoid further problems I'll keep working forwards from the 
new version.

## [1.0] - 2015-12-01

### Added

* all the things!
* can write docs to the filesystem
* developers can disable writing to the filesystem
* developers can specify where docs will be written
* prepped codebase for [eggification](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggs%20tutorial).
